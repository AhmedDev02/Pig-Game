# Pig-Game
Pig Game is a two-player dice game where the goal is to reach 100 points. Players take turns rolling a die, adding the value to their turn total. If a 1 is rolled, all points for that turn are lost. The challenge lies in deciding whether to keep rolling to increase your score or hold to avoid the risk of losing points.
